# Something about me

*I am a juniour web-developer in HTML, Css,JavaScript and C# .NET. I want to increase my knowledge in programming so I like solving some big problems. But as you can see I don't have much experience by virtue of my age. I'm only 16 years old but it's not that important because I want to develop my skills and be on the top and I will because I'm not afraid of problems that are waiting for me in this life.*

And also this is where I will post my projects for the employers.
